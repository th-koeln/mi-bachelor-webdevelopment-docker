This engraving served as the title-page to the second edition of the Wittenberg Heiligthumsbuch with an impression of Cranach's woodcut of the church of All Saints printed on the verso (Hollstein, 96). The title of the book 'Dye zaigung des hochlobwirdi= \/\/ gen hailigthumbs der Stifft \/\/ kirchen aller hailigen zu \/\/ wittenburg' was printed on the sheet above the image in letterpress. The engraving was also issued in a separate edition in which the versos are blank. \nThe image shows Elector Friedrich the Wise who ruled Saxony jointly with his brother, Duke Johann the Constant (1468-1532). They are set in a niche behind a ballustrade. Friedrich holds rosary beads in his hands and his gaze is directed piously upwards. Both are dressed in stately attire and the electoral coats of arms decorate the upper corners. Cranach has placed his insignia in a prominent position on a plaque at the centre of the ballustrade. \nTogether the brothers were responsible for enlarging the collection of treasures and relics for the church of All Saints begun by their ancestors.

Competition between Cranach and his contemporaries led to the development of the chiaroscuro woodcut, a tonal block, which simulated heightening by leaving parts of the paper white and it may have prompted him to deliberately antedate the first state by two years. Certain other arguments also cast doubt on the date. Cranach was not entitled to use the coat of arms with a serpent, seen on this print, until 1508 when it was granted to him by Duke Friedrich and in fact, it is not displayed on any other print before 1509. The most likely sequence of events was that Cranach learnt of the advances made in Augsburg on the invention of the tone block soon after his return from the Netherlands in 1508, and then produced his own version in the 'St Christopher' and 'Venus' woodcuts around 1509.\n\n1st state [Dodgson 1911, 295-296, 61a-c] [Hollstein 56.79]:\na. with the date 1506.

Although the series was most likely intended to be published in its entity in a book context, no publication is known to exist until many years later, when it first was used as illustration to 'Das Symbolum oder gemeine Bekenntnis der zwelff Aposteln', Wittenberg, Georg Rhau, 1539. Galleys from about 1512 with text exist, printed with types from Reinhart's print shop, but subsequently the Martyrdoms were published as single sheets.

The electoral shield with the two crossed swords has the earlier form, in which the lower half of the field is sable, the upper argent, while the ducal shield is shown with three leaves rather than the later five.

It is one of a small group of woodcuts of jousting tournaments designed by Cranach between 1506 and 1509, which are based on events that took place in the market-place in Wittenberg [Hollstein, VI.93.117-119]. The complex design of this print contains numerous combatants on horseback jousting with lances in a square surrounded by buildings; the knight in the lower right corner with the letter 'A' ('Alt\u00f6sterreich'?) on his caparison is seen in other prints and possibly represents the Emperor Maximilian. The coats of arms of Saxony are represented on the tapestry hanging over the balcony balustrade.\nPossibly originally designed to be hand-coloured (se version of 1st state in Dresden).\n1st state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in base\n2nd state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in chief"},"Remarks":{"de":""},"RelatedWorks":{"de":""},"Classification":{"de":"Druckgrafik","en":"Druckgrafik"},"Condition":{"de":"","en":""},"Dimensions":{"de":"Blockma\u00df: 25,6 x 37,2 cm\n[cda 2019]\n","en":"block marks: 25.6 x 37.2 cm\n[cda 2019]"},"Provenienz":{"de":"","en":""},"MaterialTechnik":{"de":"","en":""},"DatierungKuenstlersignaturUnterzeichner":"","Beschriftung":{"de":"","en":"on the knight in the lower right corner: 'A'"},"StempelZeichen":{"de":"","en":""},"VerwandteArbeiten":{"de":"","en":""},"Ausstellungsgeschichte":{"de":"","en":""}},"946837":{"Type":"virtual","Oid":946837,"ObjectName":"Holzschnitt","Inventarnummer":"LC_H081-1","Title":{"de":"Der heilige Georg zu Pferd"},"Link":"der-heilige-georg-zu-pferd","Zuschreibung":{"de":"Lucas Cranach der \u00c4ltere","en":"Lucas Cranach the Elder"},"Dated":0,"DateBeginn":1502,"DateEnd":1512,"Longtext":{"de":"","en":"St George; the knight is depicted on horseback, holding a lance; the dead dragon lies underneath.
